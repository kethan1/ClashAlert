**Overview: This project involves driving a robot car containing a Raspberry Pi. The controls are on a webpage with a joystick as well as a constant video stream where if we want it to stop, a red LED will be shown that the camera detects using OpenCV. The joystick triggers the motors that move the robot in the direction that it is supposed to move towards.**

MAKE BETTER EVENTUALLY :)
What we are doing is a representative of self driving cars. Our robot car is demonstrative of a group of self driving cars with them detecting collisions and traffic lights. We also envision that our plan to transmit the signals among the cars via 5G localized network. There is also broadcasting the signal when pedestrians are crossing. It will also be used for emergency vechiles so they have a constant feed of the best route.
