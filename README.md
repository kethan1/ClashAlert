**Overview: This project involves driving a robot car containing a Raspberry Pi. The controls are on a webpage with a joystick as well as a constant video stream that informs the user about what is in the path of the robot. If the user wants the car to stop, they will trigger a button that displays a series of red LEDs and the camera detects them using OpenCV. The joystick triggers the motors that move the robot in the direction that it is supposed to move towards. To avoid collisions, we have implemented an IR sensor that will detect objects ahead of the robot.**

**Future Goals: What we are doing is a representative of self driving cars. Our robot car is demonstrative of a group of self driving cars that are detecting collisions and traffic lights. We also envision that our plan will be enhanced when we transmit the signals among the cars via 5G localized network. To ensure the safety of pedestrians, we can broadcast the signal to other cars on the same path. It will also be used for emergency vechiles so they have a constant feed of the best route.**
